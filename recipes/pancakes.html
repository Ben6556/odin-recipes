        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is a great recipe that I found in my Grandma's recipe book. Judging from the weathered look of this recipe card, this was a family favorite.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour </li>
                <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder </li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar  </li>
                <li>1 ¼ cups milk </li>
                <li>1 egg</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted </li>
              
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.</li>
                <li>Make a well in the center and pour in the milk, egg and melted butter; mix until smooth.</li>
                <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.</li>
                <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake.</li>
                <li>Brown on both sides and serve hot.</li>
                
            </ol>
